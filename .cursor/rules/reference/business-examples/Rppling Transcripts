their data is a lot more powerful than just this sort of directory listing of
17:00
of the usernames and passwords for everyone in the business so anyone who has a fundamental graph seems to also
17:06
have um a market size in the hundreds of billions well that sounds great where do i sign
17:12
up for that sounds like you're on on track i mean do you think that there's a different
17:17
type of organization that can happen with this type of software i mean one of the things that i've been thinking about
17:23
a lot is um these organizations get sort of only so big because you know there's uh
17:29
kosa's theory of the firm right that firms get only so big and then they become sort of
17:34
um encumbered by the uh communication cost internal to that
17:40
organization that's really interesting i so i didn't i wasn't familiar with that that concept but one of the things that
17:46
we do is we try to to build a compound startup
17:51
we try and have these individual business units um that are often led by um you know
17:58
former founders rippling has a really high concentration of of people who have started companies
18:04
previously in their careers um and we hire them to basically start and run
18:10
products and business units within rippling and one of the things that we're trying
18:15
to do is actually disconnect each of these business units
18:20
from each other as much as possible um we're not there yet but sometimes people talk to me internally about how we
18:26
really need to like you know this team needs to coordinate with that team and every time i hear that i kind of
18:33
think to myself like man that sounds terrible that sounds like that's never going to work and instead like let's find a way that
18:40
they don't have to coordinate with each other and they can you know there there's some you know sla or interface
18:45
for whatever interaction they need to have and then they can operate independently without being held back by
18:52
um by the other team i mean what you were saying earlier uh and then if you combine it with this what you're sort of
18:58
saying is actually uh being able to be even a startup within a startup or a team of teams like
Rippling: a team of teams
19:05
ryan peterson likes to call it a team of teams that's sort of being supported by the software that you had to build for
19:11
the customers already which is that employee graph and then there's sort of new middleware you're building around
19:17
things called unity for instance that really i mean what it allows is a new
19:22
engineering team like product design engineering team within rippling can go from like and
19:29
basically an idea to a fully functioning sas product with thousands of customers
19:35
like seemingly overnight or maybe in the course of like six or nine months whereas if you're an external startup
19:42
trying to like you know rub two pennies together you know you might never do it yeah well that's the idea we like to
19:48
think that basically you know if you're if you're gonna start a new business inside of rippling
19:54
there's a bunch of advantages that we can provide and some of it is distribution
20:00
that you know we've been good if we look at the we launched i think five or six new products last year
20:06
and i think we will launch about six or seven new products in 2022
20:12
and each one that we launch the ramp curve is faster than the last one and so
20:17
the most recent one we launched is this product called inventory management you can think of it as like a cloud i.t
20:23
closet and so when you when you terminate an employee in rippling you have this option where we'll just
20:29
like send them a box to collect their computer and that terminated employee puts the
20:34
box the computer there's a prepaid shipping label and it goes to a warehouse that was run by one of our
20:40
partners and they then you know get the computer out they wipe it they clean it you know physically and you know and and
20:46
the the user accounts and stuff like that and then it's like listed for you so the next time you hire someone you can just ship that same computer
20:53
right back out to them and that product launched four months ago and it's already at about eight hundred thousand
21:00
dollars in ar and growing about 40 month over month and that that's the fastest that we've
21:06
had a new product grow but all of them have just increasingly been the time to hit a million in revenue the time to hit
21:13
5 million in revenue has just been shrinking with like every new product that we launch
21:18
but the other thing that you get when when you start one of these new products at riplane is there's a lot of there you
21:24
know a lot of business software ends up being built from the same fundamental
21:29
underlying lego blocks you have you know role-based permissions you have
21:35
reports and analytics workflows policies alerts and
21:41
you take those set of components and you sort of set up one data model
21:47
and a slightly different a very particular ux and you rearrange them and you get a time tracking system
21:53
but then you take the same set of underlying components and a different data model and a
21:58
different ux and suddenly you have an expense reimbursement system or
22:04
a learning management system or any number of other sort of products that you might need to build for businesses
22:10
and because because you're using the same set of sort of middleware components
22:16
over and over again some of the things that that customers really care about when they're buying
Rippling's reporting capabilities
22:22
business software that often the teams that are building these products don't care about as much
22:29
those things in rippling end up being really good a lot of companies when they build business software
22:34
they end up building reports because their client makes them do it you know they kind of clutch it on as an afterthought
22:40
but at rippling when we build reports and we go really deep on that concept and we can you know we're trying to
22:45
build a bi tool that will compete with stand-alone bi systems
22:51
and then every product that we build has has report reporting capabilities that are at that level of sophistication
22:58
i guess i'm seeing two different levels of this uh courses theory of the firm sort of playing out one is at the like
23:05
internal to rippling level where you're basically able to create new lines of business that go from zero to
23:12
multi-million dollar per year and then ideally ten to hundreds of millions in the future and that's sort of like a you
23:19
know a new innovation at the internal level and then on the on your customer
23:24
level there's this other thing that happens where you know that product that you were mentioning you know ever who
23:29
doesn't want to have proper you know laptop clean up and reuse like what happens today at most firms
23:36
they probably just walk out the the door with it with all your confidential information or you know certainly
23:42
maybe you get the laptop back and it goes in a closet someplace because someone can't stacked up in your apartment somewhere and you don't covet
23:48
i mean that's that's what happened to us is we had you know there was a woman that ran this for us and she had
23:55
just stacks of laptops piling up in her apartment in san francisco and you know things like that don't have to happen if
24:01
rippling can actually offer more and more of the standard services that are really just best practices we already
24:07
know who all of your employees are we know their home addresses it's integrated into the same flow that you
24:15
use in rippling to terminate an employee and calculate their final paycheck and
24:20
administer cobra and all that kind of stuff so if you add this thing it's it's no more work nothing else to manage
24:27
one of the things that sounds really powerful that is probably really underplayed and
24:33
uh one thing that i really love about what you've done with rippling is like you always had a great focus on this was
A different way to support customers
24:40
customer support like i just always loved the idea of getting your engineering team to go and actually feel
24:47
the pain of your customers because then it comes out in a bug report and most people sort of just
24:53
drop it right in the bit bucket like you don't do anything with it but you've taken a much different stance like from
24:59
the beginning and then now it sounds like you've taken uh an even more of a leadership role in
25:05
like pioneering this like radical form of uh customer support actually the
25:10
scariest launch i've done in my entire career we did a few weeks ago because we we took this move where we
25:17
started publishing uh daily customer support stats basically all of the data that i look at
25:23
internally for our support team we started publishing right on our public-facing
25:30
site you can go look at it's rippling rippling.com support status
25:35
and it's scary because you know look we're not perfect and we've had we've had blips in the past on our support and
25:42
i'm sure we will have blips in the future and when we do it's going to be out there for everyone to see you know
25:48
competitors customers everything but i think it's really the right thing for the industry and for our customers
25:55
because um first it really holds us accountable and then for customers one of the things
26:00
that we find a lot is look i think we have a really cool product and really differentiated
26:06
technology that solves a real problem but what we find is that in in sales conversations with customers
26:13
the big question they always have is about the support quality and particularly for a product like what
26:19
we do that's so core to your business if you're running someone's payroll they get really nervous about what happens if
26:25
it doesn't work and i can't reach someone at the end of the day we sort of realized and the reason we decided to do
26:30
this in addition to it being the right thing to do is we sort of figured no one's going to believe us if we just say
26:36
oh no we have great support because everyone says they have great support and most companies don't and the only
26:42
way to really get credit for it is to take this leap and put yourself out there and actually publish the
26:48
underlying data and so my hope is that a lot of other companies will follow suit and do this
26:55
and i think that if you have a vendor or software company that you're working with that doesn't do this
27:03
you should sort of think about why they're not willing to do it um and that should sort of tell you something um
27:10
there are also i mean we've done support very differently since since we started and there are a number of i think
27:16
i think really interesting things that we do to sort of try and make these support stats really good
27:22
and it used to be i think one of the things that happens is when you're an early stage company i think you can have great support just
27:29
by really caring a lot about support and the problem is as you start to scale
27:35
just caring about it like doesn't really matter anymore um that will only kind of get you so far the prioritization thing
27:42
and then when you have 10 things that are all priority none of them have a priority then i think it's about you can
27:47
make it a priority but it still sucks i think it you know just caring doesn't matter anymore you
27:54
have to be like really analytical about sort of how you're going to make it great and and
28:01
solve this sort of scaling challenge that's your dashboard right a dashboard or something the dashboard you can see
28:06
is one thing but there are a few other things that we've done um and one of the things that was really interesting
28:12
we had about a year ago we were struggling with support um and um we had you know much longer response
28:19
times than than we wanted um and i was getting daily reports that showed me
28:26
median time to first response on all of the different sort of channels
28:32
that we offer support through chat through email through et cetera et cetera one of the things that we started doing and it was incredible it solved
28:39
this problem like overnight is i forced the team to start reporting on 90th percentiles
28:46
instead of 50th percent oh yes and so i said basically look we're not going to look at the median
28:52
and we looked at the medium and what we the reason i did this is we discovered that 90th percentile was like way worse
28:58
than the median and i said the only thing that i that that anyone's allowed to look at and the
29:03
only thing that i want to see is the 90th percentile which is a much more punishing statistic it basically
29:09
says it's like what is the worst 10 of the support interactions that you have
29:15
and we started reporting on that and within a week the support time to first response
29:21
numbers dropped so dramatically because what happens is when you're if you want to improve your support and you're
29:26
looking at the media and support interaction it's really hard to figure out like what you need to do there's
29:31
kind of you're kind of like well i don't know like what do we do like you know you kind of go to your team like try harder guys you know like try and get
29:36
back to customers faster but when you look at 90th percentiles it immediately calls out exceptions you
29:43
start looking at like well that's crazy like why did it take us you know
29:49
you know an hour to respond to a customer chat and you look at it and you start figuring out it's much easier to
29:56
wrap your head around you notice things like in our case we noticed that you know we would open up sort of support at
30:03
you know 8 a.m or something like that and we would discover that gosh you know a lot of the support managers were
30:10
having one-on-ones with their team right at 8 am when we opened when we opened up the chat support line and so people were
30:15
sitting there without getting answers and so you could see that stuff when you focused on the 90th percentile
30:21
and the worst interactions and one things we found is we didn't even look at the medians but the medians
30:27
dropped astronomically because it's impossible if you focus on just chopping
30:33
off the worst 10 of support interactions it's impossible not to improve the
30:38
medians as well and like everything just dropped dramatically within the course of about two weeks so one of the
30:44
learnings that i had was like if you're if you want to have great support as a company you've got to focus on the
30:50
relentlessly on the outliers on the worst interactions and that sort of naturally brings things down the
30:56
other thing that really worked well for us was looking at was routing
Routing through machine learning
31:02
we spent a lot of time building systems to route tickets in software
31:07
really it's one of the only places in rippling where we do a lot of machine learning but basically figuring out ways where
31:15
you could constantly as our support organization has grown you know we have now i think like two or
31:21
three hundred support reps and what what you want is as your support organization grows you want to constantly
31:27
basically shard your specialties until you get to narrow narrower and narrower
31:33
areas of focus and so when we were a small company it was like well you know bucket for a bucket for payroll a bucket
31:38
for single sign on an app management a bucket for devices and then as you get bigger you take that payroll bucket and
31:45
you break it down further and you have a specialty for you know benefits deductions a specialty for
31:52
garnishments a specialty for all these different things and you just keep cutting it further and further and further so that
31:58
you know every rep in the company has a specialty that they become like really
32:03
the the product expert on you know they understand all of the things that go wrong for
32:08
customers with that product what are the questions they have what are the issues that they encounter and because of that
32:15
when you email in to riplane and you have a question your question gets routed to someone who knows these issues
32:22
like backwards and forwards and can answer it immediately what that does is that dramatically improves the
32:29
likelihood that they can answer your question on the first response which means you're more satisfied it means
32:34
they get back to you faster and it also is more efficient from a cost perspective because those interactions
32:40
where you have like 10 back and forth with someone those are always just way more costly and leave them like much
32:45
less satisfied how do i mean both of these are incredible sort of actually nuggets that are really it's almost like
32:52
finding something in the wild it's like some new phenomenon that turns out to be true like the 90th percentile not the
33:00
50th for instance is like that's fascinating do you have any tips for people watching
33:05
who are running companies who are just trying to figure out like well how did you learn that i have have this theory
How to use the extremes of your data
33:12
that that in a lot of places in a company um you're much better off looking at
33:17
streams of individual data points than aggregate data an example is in customer
33:22
support is um you know i look at sort of overall you know csat scores and time to
33:29
first response and things like that but the thing that i've always found most powerful is there's a slack channel that we set
33:36
up where anytime someone marks themselves as dissatisfied with a support interaction
33:43
it sends a message to the slack channel it includes a bunch of information about the customer you know like who who the
33:48
person was what their role is with the company the size of the customer the the products that they purchased in rippling
33:55
and like a link to the ticket and a summary of the support interaction at one point i looked at every single time
34:02
someone marked us like thumbs down i would click in and watch that ticket and i don't do it every single time anymore
34:07
but sometimes when i have a spare hour i'll go in and just kind of look at the last 25 that came through and sometimes
34:14
you go in and you know look sometimes customers are upset but actually like i look at it and i think we did a great
34:20
job on the support side and i always think that that that type of
34:25
that way of looking at the company looking at streams of anecdata rather than sort of global top-down
34:32
metrics is a lot more powerful precisely because you can uncover a lot of these issues you get a lot more
34:38
insight because you have a lot more context aggregate data is helpful when you fully
34:44
understand the problem and you just need to kind of measure your performance but if if you don't
34:50
fully understand it which is most of the time the situation that you're in at you know running a company i think anecdata
34:58
is superior to data like nine times out of ten um because you have all of this
35:04
context around the issue and and you start to notice things that you're like well this is what's going on
35:11
in this case and you notice patterns that then lead you to make better decisions
35:16
i'm spotting a really important pattern here which is you know whether it's anecdata or data or
35:23
it really is about just awareness and consciousness like if there's a problem you need to know about it
35:30
and then it's led you to very innovative things like you know there's a billboard outside here
35:36
that actually has your number of seconds or minutes to a customer support person
35:42
right now yeah so one of the cool things one of the side benefits i think of starting to publish
35:48
our support metrics we think of it you know we were inspired by sort of like status pages for uptime for
35:54
websites you know kind of like why isn't there a status page for customer support that's doing the same thing one of the
36:00
sort of benefits of this is that look now when we get customers who are you know frustrated with the support
36:06
quality they have with you know one of our competitors for example or they're nervous about you know starting with a
36:12
new company and they don't know how good the support is going to be we can just say look you don't have to
36:17
take our word for it we're publishing all the data on this like you can go see it yourself and that that's been really
36:23
powerful for example we tried we started reaching out to prospective customers with
36:29
this message about our real-time support stats and the conversion rates on some
36:35
of these marketing campaigns are double or triple what they were
36:40
for just our standard outreach about our product like like pointing out this sort of like
36:46
measured public support quality has been phenomenal from a marketing perspective and so that's why we're now doing things
36:53
like putting up billboards to sort of talk about sort of hey look here's here's yesterday's time to first
36:58
response for rippling support in seconds yeah i think that's so powerful because you run
37:04
across businesses all the time and they say that they're customer you know focused or you know and the hard part is
37:11
you know don't look at what they say look at what actually happens that's right and how do you how do you know if
37:16
they i mean look and maybe maybe they're incredibly well intentioned you know like maybe they they really want great
37:21
support but at the end of the day you know uh caring about it is not enough like you
37:28
you need to be really steely-eyed about sort of how you're gonna deliver this
37:35
experience to customers effectively i think the only way for customers to really know that is to like see it in
37:41
stark relief and see the data i mean obviously i'm biased because i got to see you like in multiple over many many
37:47
years build multiple companies but i don't know this focus it's sort of like
37:52
this data oriented hyper empathy for the customer also like this innovation of like compound startup i mean
38:00
i really think you're gonna build this trillion dollar company man i hope so that'd be great but that's what it takes
38:06
like i think that we just live in sort of a new realm where a lot of these companies were built
38:11
without software they were built without like the ability to have that sort of consciousness about like oh this thing's
38:17
happening we need to fix it in this way but you're doing it so thank you well thank you
