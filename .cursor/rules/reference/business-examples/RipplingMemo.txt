Rippling Memo
Rippling’s premise is that businesses should have a single system for
employee information across every department within the company.
That’s not the way it works today. 
OVERVIEW
Most businesses have dozens of systems that maintain a list of their employees, and for the most part,
none of these systems talk to each other or to any
central system about who these employees are.
Sometimes, these business systems only need to
know a little bit about each employee — maybe just
each employee’s username, and a password, so that
the system can authenticate employees when they
log in. Other systems go deeper, and need to know
each employee’s department, manager, salary, home
address, and more.
Whenever something changes about an employee,
many (and sometimes, all) of these systems need
to be updated, and because they don’t point to any
central authority, they each need to be updated separately and by hand.
We believe that the effort to maintain this fragmented
employee data across all of a company’s business
systems is, secretly, the root cause of almost all the
administrative work of running a company.
There should be a single system of employee data
that sits underneath every other business system.
Companies and their employees could come to this
one place, and make changes to employees in this one
system, and that system would handle the propagation out to every other business system.
That’s what Rippling is, and that’s what we do.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy, in a nutshell, has 3 parts:
Part I: If you can be the system of record for
employee data, you can build a really successful
business.
Being the system of record for employee data is lucrative because this system has platform power that
can be used in other business software and services
categories that need to access this underlying employee data.
At one extreme, if you’re the system of record for
employee data, you can build adjacent products with
exclusive access to your system. That’s what we did at
my last company, Zenefits. Zenefits was a system of
record for employee data within the HR department,
and in order for clients to connect their insurance
up to Zenefits, they had to make us their insurance
broker.
Because this connectivity made life easier for the
client, most Zenefits clients chose to make us their
broker. But we could have arbitrarily done this in any
number of other areas with a strong tie to the employee record, besides insurance.
And, you can take a different approach, which we prefer at Rippling — you can partner broadly with other
companies and be a reseller: you can allow other
companies to operate in your system, you can bring
them new clients, and in exchange, they pay you a cut
of their revenue.
This belief — that the system of record for employee
data is valuable — is the least unique, and probably
the least controversial, part of our strategy.
Introduction
Rippling’s premise is that businesses should have a single system for employee information
across every department within the company. That’s not the way it works today.
2 Rippling Memo
Almost every other HRIS and payroll company views
the world this way. ADP is the largest payroll company
in the US by market cap, and they make most of their
revenue not selling payroll — but by selling a host of
ADP add-on services (time tracking, performance
management, benadmin, etc) that happen to plug in
to the core ADP payroll system. Certainly Zenefits,
Gusto, and Namely also count this as a part of their
strategy.
Outside of HR, this is also Microsoft’s strategy in
their enterprise business segment. Microsoft’s Active
Directory is also a system of record for employee data
— just one that happens to be used by the IT department instead of the HR department. Microsoft brings
Active Directory into a company, and then upsells the
company on other Microsoft services — Exchange
Server, Sharepoint, Windows PCs — that plug cleanly
in to Active Directory.
So, many companies agree that being the system of
record for employee data is valuable, and Rippling
is not the only company gunning for this prize. The
question then becomes, how do you “win” at being the
system of record for employee data?
Part II - Onboarding Software makes you the
system of record for employee data.
There is a button you click in Rippling to hire an
employee. As a hiring manager, you tell us the new
employee’s Salary, Manager, Department, Work Location, and a few other things.
Rippling then reaches out to the new hire, generates
their paperwork for electronic signature, and then
asks the employee for details like their Social Security
Number, Home Address, and Bank Account Number.
These hiring and onboarding flows are the way this
new employee object is assembled. Rippling is collecting each of the employee attributes that make up this
employee record, we are writing them to our database, and then we are metering them out to all of our
clients’ downstream business systems.
By virtue of being the ingestion point for this employee data, and because we are upstream of everyone
else in this process, Rippling is the system of record
by definition. Because every other business system
is receiving its information about the company’s
employees from us, we become the de facto source of
truth.
Stated slightly differently: if a new hire were to misenter their Social Security Number into Rippling, it
would be wrong everywhere — in payroll, with insurance carriers, with the 401k provider, etc.
As a result of this, we are uniquely fanatical about
employee onboarding software. For our competitors,
employee onboarding tools may be useful features,
helpful to clients. But for us, onboarding software
is the only thing that matters, because if you win at
onboarding, you win everything else.
Eventually, though, if we’re successful, other companies will come around to our point of view on the central role this software will play in the B2B ecosystem,
and will refocus their own efforts to develop employee
onboarding software. The question then becomes,
“how do you win at employee onboarding software?”
Part III - To win at employee onboarding, you can’t
be monogamous to any single department or
functional area.
Many companies maintain informal checklists of the
tasks they need to complete when hiring a new employee. To win at onboarding, you need to automate
more of a company’s new hire checklist than anyone
else.
But, these onboarding tasks cut across many different departments — it’s our experience that about
30% of a company’s onboarding tasks are HR-related.
About 40% are IT-related. And there’s a smattering of
Finance, Legal, and Facilities-related tasks that need
to be completed for every new hire, as well.
If your company’s mission is to make HR software, or
to build software for the Finance department, or the
IT organization, you can only solve a portion of this
onboarding problem — because the onboarding pain
that businesses have isn’t specific to one department
or functional area.
To effectively solve employee onboarding, you have to
orient your product around employee lifecycle events
— getting hired, getting a new job or role, moving to a
new address, getting promoted, leaving the company
— and follow the downstream implications of these
lifecycle events wherever they lead.
3 Rippling Memo
This means you need to have tentacles into all of
these different departments and functional areas,
and all the different 3rd party systems they use. If you
build your software for one particular buyer or department, you will eventually lose to the company that
solves the whole problem.
Onboarding Sidebar
It’s worth noting that the term “onboarding software”
is used to mean different things by different companies.
Some companies have built project management
apps for HR that assign out tasks and track completion whenever someone joins the company. These
apps are sometimes called “onboarding software,”
but they bear no relation to the product we have built,
because they lack any downstream systems connectivity.
As a result, they’re both less useful to the employer
(these apps can assign you work, but they can’t do
it for you), and strategically less interesting (without
downstream systems connectivity, they are no longer
a source of truth for employee data).

Product Overview
The best way to understand our product is to see it. We encourage you to get a demo of the product from us or,
failing that, visit our marketing website at www.rippling.com, which gives a good high-level overview.
RIPPLING IS A HYBRID OF THREE
DIFFERENT SOFTWARE CATEGORIES:
• An all-in-one payroll, benefits, and HRIS system.
• An “Identity” / SSO / Password manager system, akin to Okta, OneLogin and OnePassword.
• An endpoint device management system, akin
to JAMF and similar systems for Windows PCs.
On the surface, this is a weird combination. It makes
sense only because these three systems are each
hubs for employee data within a company.
HR systems’ connection to employee data is obvious.
But it’s not immediately clear how IT systems are tied
to the employee record.
IT’s connection to the employee record is that IT
security is ultimately about controlling systems access — who should have access to what systems and
software within your company? How should those
users be configured within those systems? What level
of permissions should they have?
Those questions are, in turn, really about ‘who are
your employees?’ and ‘what is their role or level or
function in your organization, and therefore what type
of access do they need to do their job?’
Those questions — questions which underlie a great
deal of the daily administrative work performed by IT
professionals as they set up and configure accounts
and computers and systems — are fundamentally
questions about the employee record.
Stated differently, Okta sometimes describes their
category as “Employee Identity.” But, we believe this
name is, for Okta, aspirational at best. Okta’s actual
product is Single-Sign-On and password management. Any true system of employee identity — going
5 Rippling Memo
back to the original meaning of the word “identity” —
would be inseparable from information about each
employee’s role, department, and function within a
company. In other words, a company’s HR data.
One small example of this:
In many companies, IT is responsible for maintaining
company email lists. A hypothetical company, Acme
Co, might have 56 people on the email list ‘engineering@acme.com.’ Current IT systems will all treat the
56 people on the list as “users,” without understanding anything about their underlying role within the
business. But these aren’t 56 random individuals!
They’re engineers, in the engineering department.
If you could speak to your IT systems in terms of HR
concepts like someone’s department, or role, or work
location, you could just add that department to the
email list. And this, in turn, would dramatically simplify
the administration of those systems.
One of my favorite parts of a Rippling demo is when I
show prospects how you can add not only individuals,
but also HR concepts like the “Engineering Department,” or a particular work location, or all managers in
the company, to an email list in Rippling:
The neat thing about this is that Rippling isn’t just
going back and adding all of the individuals in those
buckets to that email list in GSuite or Office365. Rippling will also maintain the fidelity of that data going
forward — so that the next time you hire an engineer,
or the next time someone gets promoted to be a manager, they’re going to be added to that email list.
And, taking that one step further: When you hire
someone in Rippling and you tell us this person is in
the engineering department, that changes everything
about how Rippling sets them up in your systems:
It changes what systems they’ll have access to — AWS
and GitHub perhaps, but not Salesforce. It changes
what email lists they are subscribed to. It changes
what software is installed on their computer.
And when someone’s role within an organization
changes, Rippling isn’t just changing payroll and HR
systems — we’re reconfiguring the systems they have
access to, the email lists they are subscribed to, and
the software and level of access they have on their
work computer.

Competition
OVERVIEW
As mentioned previously, Rippling is a hybrid of three
different software categories:
• An all-in-one payroll, benefits, and HRIS system
• An “identity” / access management system
• An endpoint device management system
This also means that Rippling competes with three
very different types of companies. Not every deal involves all three components — some deals are IT only,
some deals are HR-only and of course many deals are
both.
COMPETITOR BREAKDOWN
• On the payroll and HR side, we compete against
Gusto, Zenefits, Namely, ADP, Paychex, and
other similar companies. If a client chooses to
use Rippling on the payroll and HR side, we are
almost always replacing one of these systems.
• On the identity side, we compete against Okta,
OneLogin, LastPass, OnePassword, and similar
companies. We’re much less likely to be replacing one of these systems — most companies we
sell to haven’t purchased them yet.
• On the device management side, we compete
against JAMF (for mac), Microsoft (for PC management), and a few newer, but smaller, competitors. As with Identity systems, we’re much
less likely to be replacing one of these systems
— most companies we sell to haven’t purchased
them yet.
There are ways in which Rippling wins or loses going
head to head against any individual one of these
competitors (for what it’s worth, on the HR side, we
believe our product is superior to every other system
on the market).
But the larger dynamic is that each of these competitors thinks of themselves far more narrowly than
Rippling does: they make HR software, or Identity
software, or device management software. It’s embedded in their culture and mission statements and
taglines. These companies are going to stay in their
swim lanes.
They might partner — but these partnership will
always be thin tethers connecting otherwise unrelated
systems.

Performance to Date
OVERVIEW
We launched our benefits administration product
around May 2018, and most of our sales metrics
improved dramatically at that time. Internally, May
2018 was the point where we shifted our focus from
product expansion to revenue growth.
Rippling has grown unusually quickly since that time,
and we closed January 2019 with $XXmm in ARR.
We’ve averaged 20% Month over Month growth since
January 2018, but that growth rate appears to be accelerating — in the last 4 months, our average growth
rate was 25%, and in January it was 29%. The time it
takes for our revenue to double recently dropped from
four months to three.
While many startups have revenue graphs that go up
and to the right, it is much less common for a graph of
month over month growth rates to do the same:
8 Rippling Memo
NPS SCORE
Equally important is that this growth has not come at
the cost of client satisfaction. Our Net Promoter Score
in January was 70, and has averaged 66 over the last
several months:
R&D INVESTMENT
Building something like Rippling isn’t cheap. As you’ll
see if you take a demo, the product surface area is
large. To hit our MVP, we’ve had to (re)build a payroll,
benefits, and HRIS system that took companies like
Zenefits, Gusto, and Namely years and tens of millions
of dollars to build. And, we’ve had to build versions of
Okta, OnePassword, and JAMF alongside it.
To do this, we’ve invested in a great deal of up-front
R&D. For most of the last two years, Rippling was a
company of almost entirely engineers (there are just
over 40 today, or roughly 2/3 of our headcount). It’s
only recently that we’ve been growing the sales team.
The downside of this is that building something like
Rippling wasn’t cheap, and the company’s total OpEx
burn to date — roughly $XXmm — is more substantial
than most startups as a result.
However, we believe that our growth rates demonstrate that our bet was essentially correct — we’ve
built the right product, one that customers want, and
we’re now winning deals against much larger and
more mature companies that have spent a lot more to
get to where we are.
Our gross margins show that the product is software
end to end, and our sales and marketing ratios (magic
number, etc) show that this growth is based on sound
fundamentals.
9 Rippling Memo
Why Now?
I know this is a popular question for some firms so I’m including answers below, but the simple truth is that I
think Rippling could have been, and should have been, built seven years ago. But it wasn’t. So, we’re building it
now. With that caveat, here are some reasons it’s a bit easier today:
THE PAIN IS INCREASING
Five years ago, the sales organization at Zenefits
mostly used just one system: Salesforce. Today, most
SaaS sales organizations are probably closing in on
10. Internally at Rippling, we use Salesforce, but also
Zoom, Calendly, Outreach, Gong, Intercom, and Marketo. Add in the marketing team, and there’s probably
another dozen or so.
As a result, there’s now a systems administration
headache in the sales department that didn’t exist
previously. Someone in the sales department — the
VP of sales, or sales ops — needs to add new hires
to each of these systems. If someone gets promoted
from SDR to Account Executive, their access needs
to be reconfigured across these systems. And if you
don’t shut off access immediately when someone
leaves, you risk leaking sensitive customer information.
In some ways, the deadweight loss from the SaaS
revolution is this increasing systems complexity.
The more new services there are, the more you need
something like Rippling to sit underneath them and tie
them together.
THIS IS THE LOGICAL NEXT LEAP
IN HR TECHNOLOGY
Zenefits was the first company to market “All-in-one
HR.” By combining previously-disconnected systems
for payroll, benefits, and HR, Zenefits gave you a button to hire someone, and they were automagically
set up in all your different HR systems. Regardless
of Zenefits’ ultimate outcome, we were right about
the market. This market positioning (and to a lesser
extent the product) was largely copied by others —
Gusto, Namely, ADP, and Paychex all now describe
themselves as “All in one HR.”
But the pain point that Zenefits solved (the single
onboarding flow for all your HR systems) isn’t unique
to the HR department. Now that everyone is All-inone-HR, the logical next step is to extend this concept across the entire company, pushing outside the
boundaries of the HR department.
SOME MARKET EVOLUTION MADE
RIPPLING’S PRODUCT EASIER TO BUILD
• Okta’s success in the enterprise market has led
to many companies building SAML and user
API endpoints we were able to plug in to, to get
hundreds of integrations live without the need
for slow-moving partnerships.
• It’s easier to build a payroll system than it was
5 years ago because you can use off-the-shelf
tax engines sold by XX and outsource tax-filing
and payment to vendors such as XX. It’s also
easier to build benefits administration software
because of vendors like XX and XX. (At Zenefits,
we had to essentially build XX and XX in order to
manage insurance — now those pieces can be
vendor relationships).
• Very high bar for MVP—you need to build a lot
of product for Rippling V1. You need to hire a
lot of engineers, and raise a lot of seed money
up-front for the build stage. I would not have
been able to finance this company the first time
around. Additionally, given this product-surfacearea problem, React and API-first development
make it easier to build a large-surface-area product and scale the engineering team horizontally
with less overhead.

Network Effects &
the ‘Supermarket for SaaS’
RIPPLING IS NOT AN HR SYSTEM
Rippling is not an HR system — we call it an Employee
Management System to distinguish it from HRIS
systems, precisely because we think the problem we
solve is much broader than HR, and the right system
to solve this problem is a level down in the stack from
an HR system, or even the HR department itself.
We think every company that currently has a payroll system would be better served by an Employee
Management System, instead — one that integrates
broadly to manage employee data across the company. Over time, if we’re right, perhaps markets will
shift in this direction.
It’s worth asking: “How will the market for employee
management systems be different than the one for
payroll and HR software?”
One key difference is network effects.
Today, ADP is the largest payroll company in the
United States. But the market is fragmented. ADP
only has about 15% - 20% market share, and there
are tens of thousands of payroll service bureaus.
That’s because there’s no self-reinforcing advantage
to being the market leader — nothing about ADP’s
position as the market leader makes my experience
as their client any better.
That is, in part, because ADP views their world narrowly. In ADP’s world, there are only 7 or 8 systems
that abutt payroll and HRIS — things like time tracking, performance management, benefits administration, and retirement.
But an employee management system has many
more adjacencies than a payroll system — probably
70 or 80 thousand of them.
This introduces a different dynamic — one where any
market leader has swiftly compounding advantages
over the other competitors in the space. The company
with the most integrations will get the most customers, because clients will naturally choose the product
that can connect with the most of their current and
future business systems, and the company with the
most clients will get the most integrations — because
3rd-party engineers can only build and support apps
in a limited number of systems and will naturally let
market share guide their decisions on where to build.
The effect of this shift is similar to how the introduction of smartphone app stores led to rapid concentration of market share in the handset industry. This
new market for Employee Management Systems will
be much more concentrated than the one for payroll
software: perhaps the market leader has 60% market
share, and the number two player has 30% market
share, and everyone else is fighting of the remaining
10%.
As a result, the market leaders for employee management systems could be successful on a much larger
scale than even the most successful of today’s payroll
and HRIS companies.
The bull case for Rippling is that we could be one of
them.
