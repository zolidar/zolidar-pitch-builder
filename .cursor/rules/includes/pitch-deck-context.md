# Auto-Include: Pitch Deck Context

**This context is automatically included when working on investor pitch deck slides or presentations.**

## 🏆 Absolute Priority Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### SLIDE DIMENSIONS ⚠️
- All content MUST fit within SlideContainer.tsx dimensions
- Footer space is reserved - cannot be used for content
- Target: 13" laptop screen in maximized browser window
- **Check dimensions BEFORE creating any content**

### DATA ACCURACY 🚫
- NEVER fabricate statistics, metrics, or business data
- Only use data explicitly provided by the deck builder
- Leave `[PLACEHOLDER]` when real data is missing
- Ask for actual data rather than making estimates

## 🎯 Khosla's Core Principles (PRIMARY METHODOLOGY)

When building, editing, or reviewing pitch deck slides, ALWAYS apply these core principles from Khosla's "Nail Your Raise" methodology:

### The 5-Second Rule ⏱️
**CRITICAL TEST**: Every slide must pass the 5-second test
- Show slide to viewer for 5 seconds, take it down
- Can they state the ONE clear message? 
- If not, the slide is too complex and must be simplified
- One message per slide, period

### Headlines Drive Everything 📝
- Slide titles should be **messages, not topics**
- Example: "Team engineered for this opportunity" NOT "Team"
- Headlines alone should tell your complete investment story
- Emotional and specific, not generic: "We save valuable lives" not "Market opportunity"

### Less Is More Philosophy 🎯
- **High signal-to-clutter ratio**: Remove every unnecessary element
- Max 4-5 lines per slide, <30 words total
- White space is your friend - don't fill every pixel
- Only include graphics that directly support the core message
- Test every element: does it convey something or just distract?

### Narrative Arc Over Logic 📖
- **Story trumps completeness**: Put details in appendix, keep narrative clean
- Follow emotional flow: Hook → Problem → Solution → Advantage → Proof
- "Left hook, right hook" - make every slide a visceral punch
- Start with boldest statement you can defend, end with "Did I prove it?"

### Address Fear and Greed 🎭
- **Investor emotions**: 90% emotional decision, 10% logical justification
- **Greed triggers**: Massive upside, unfair advantages, huge markets
- **Fear management**: Address risks upfront, show mitigation plans
- **Engineer takeaways**: Help investors write the right memo to partners

## 🎨 Visual Design Standards (AESTHETIC FOUNDATION)

**Source**: `.cursor/rules/core/slide-design.md`
- Follow established color palette and typography hierarchy
- Use proven layout patterns and grid systems
- Maintain component consistency (cards, icons, spacing)
- Ensure professional appearance - no cluttered or ugly designs

## ✍️ Headline Writing Patterns (CONTENT CREATION)

**Source**: `.cursor/rules/content/headline-writing.md`
- **Problem Headlines**: Dramatic questions + urgent statements + specific statistics
- **Solution Headlines**: Concept naming + process explanation + value multiplier  
- **Traction Headlines**: Strategic advantage + partnerships + financial positioning
- **Headlines are MESSAGES, not topics** - they should advance the narrative

## Slide Creation Checklist ✅

For EVERY slide you create or edit:

1. **📏 DIMENSION CHECK**: Will this fit in SlideContainer.tsx?
2. **🔍 DATA VERIFICATION**: Is all information real and provided?
3. **🕒 5-Second Test**: Does it pass? One clear message only?
4. **📊 Visual Hierarchy**: Where do eyes go first? Is it obvious?
5. **🎯 Signal/Noise**: Can you remove anything without losing meaning?
6. **💭 Emotional Impact**: Does this create visceral reaction or just inform?
7. **📖 Story Flow**: Does this advance the narrative arc?
8. **🔗 Investor Psychology**: Does this trigger greed or manage fear?

## Common Violations to Avoid ❌

- **Multiple messages per slide**: Confuses investors, dilutes impact
- **Gratuitous graphics**: Add cognitive load without supporting message
- **Generic headlines**: "Competition" instead of "We cost $2 vs competitor's $105,000"
- **Cluttered design**: Text to edges, competing visual elements
- **Logical order**: Boring structure instead of emotional storytelling
- **Hidden advantages**: Don't bury your unfair competitive advantages

## Three-Framework Integration 🎯

**Priority Hierarchy for Pitch Deck Creation:**

1. **PRIMARY: Khosla Principles** - Emotional storytelling, 5-second rule, clear headlines
2. **SECONDARY: Conrad Memo Depth** - For complex platform businesses requiring strategic explanation  
3. **TERTIARY: Sequoia Structure** - Systematic coverage ensuring comprehensive due diligence readiness

**Integration Approach:** Use Sequoia's structure as the skeleton, Khosla's principles as the soul, and Conrad's depth when strategic complexity adds value.
