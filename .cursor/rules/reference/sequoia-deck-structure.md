## Integration with Khosla Principles

### Structural Framework + Emotional Storytelling
**Sequoia provides the skeleton, Khosla provides the soul:**

- **Company Purpose** → Apply Khosla's "30-second commercial" principles
- **Problem/Solution** → Use 5-second rule for clarity, emotional impact
- **Market Size** → Avoid "top-down BS numbers," focus on bottom-up validation
- **Competition** → Frame through advantages (Khosla) not just feature comparison
- **Financials** → Command your numbers, focus on key metrics only
- **Each slide** → Must pass 5-second test and have single clear message

### Narrative Arc Within Structure
**Follow Sequoia's order but maintain Khosla's storytelling:**

1. **Hook** (Company Purpose) → Boldest statement you can defend
2. **Problem** → Visceral pain, not vitamin
3. **Solution** → "If I can prove X, you should invest"
4. **Why Now** → Timing creates greed, urgency
5. **Market** → Size of opportunity (greed trigger)
6. **Competition** → Your unfair advantages
7. **Product** → How you deliver the promise
8. **Business Model** → How you capture value
9. **Team** → Gene pool engineered for this opportunity
10. **Financials** → Proof of scalable economics
11. **Close** → "Did I prove X to you?"

## Sequoia-Specific Best Practices

### Executive Summary Excellence
**Most critical slide - investors decide here:**
- **One sentence company purpose** at the top
- **Key metrics** that prove traction
- **Market size** and your capture potential
- **Funding ask** and what it achieves
- **Investment thesis** in 30 seconds

### Market Sizing Methodology
**Sequoia's TAM/SAM/SOM Framework:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Top-down market research
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: Bottom-up analysis of reachable customers
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Realistic capture based on competition and execution

**Integration with Khosla's "No BS Numbers":**
- Lead with SAM/SOM, not inflated TAM
- Show bottom-up calculation methodology
- Connect to actual customer validation
- Avoid generic "$4T healthcare spend" statements

### Competition Framework
**Sequoia's systematic approach + Khosla's advantage focus:**
- **List all relevant competitors** (comprehensive view)
- **Identify competitive advantages** (your unfair advantages)
- **Show strategic positioning** (why you win long-term)
- **Address throughout deck** (not just one slide)

### Business Model Depth
**Sequoia expects comprehensive commercial analysis:**
- **Revenue model** and pricing strategy
- **Unit economics** and lifetime value
- **Sales motion** and go-to-market strategy
- **Distribution channels** and partnerships
- **Customer acquisition** and retention metrics

## Common Integration Patterns

### Sequoia Structure + Khosla Execution
1. **Use Sequoia's slide sequence** for logical flow
2. **Apply Khosla's headline principles** to each slide
3. **Maintain emotional narrative arc** within structured format
4. **Build comprehensive appendix** for detailed backup

### When Structures Conflict
**Priority Resolution:**
1. **Khosla's clarity rules** always win (5-second test, single message)
2. **Sequoia's completeness** guides what topics to cover
3. **Narrative flow** trumps logical completeness when necessary
4. **Investor preference** may dictate which structure to emphasize

### Hybrid Approaches
**Best of Both Worlds:**
- **Pitch deck**: Khosla's emotional storytelling in Sequoia's structure
- **Appendix**: Sequoia's comprehensive analysis for detailed questions
- **Executive summary**: Condensed version following Sequoia's modern format
- **Memo supplement**: Conrad's strategic depth for platform businesses

**Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Khosla's clarity and impact** (never compromise on this)
