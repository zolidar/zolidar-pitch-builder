## What This Is

An AI-powered pitch deck framework that transforms your business narrative into professional investor presentations using battle-tested methodologies from Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and successful platform companies.

The key to success: High-quality business context in the `startup-context/` folder. The AI can only be as good as the information you provide about your business.

## Complete Deck Generation Example

Once you've prepared your business context, you can generate an entire pitch deck with a single comprehensive prompt:

```
Based on @startup-context/narrative.md and @startup-context/supporting-docs/, create a complete 15-slide investor pitch deck following this structure:

1. **Title Slide** - Company name, tagline, and presenter info
2. **Problem** - Specific pain points with emotional impact (5-second rule)
3. **Solution** - Your unique approach and key benefits
4. **Market Opportunity** - TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up sizing
5. **Product Demo** - Core functionality and user experience
6. **Traction** - Growth metrics, customer validation, key wins
7. **Business Model** - Revenue streams, pricing, unit economics
8. **Competition** - Competitive landscape and differentiation
9. **Go-to-Market** - Customer acquisition strategy and channels
10. **Team** - Founder backgrounds and key hires
11. **Financials** - 3-year projections and key assumptions
12. **Funding Ask** - Amount, use of funds, milestones
13. **Vision** - Long-term impact and market position
14. **Appendix** - Supporting data, detailed metrics, backup slides
15. **Thank You** - Contact information and next steps

For each slide:
- Follow Khosla's emotional storytelling principles
- Use Sequoia's systematic structure for comprehensive coverage
- Maintain consistent design system from existing slides
- Include specific data from my context files, not generic placeholders
- Create compelling narratives that build toward the funding ask

Start with slides 1-5, then I'll review before continuing with the rest.
```

This single prompt leverages all your prepared context to create a professional, comprehensive pitch deck.

## How to Use AI Prompts

The key to success is context-driven prompting. The AI needs to understand your business deeply to create compelling slides.

### Essential Setup Prompts

**Initial Context Setting:**
```
I'm building a pitch deck for [COMPANY NAME], a [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]. 

Our business model is [BUSINESS MODEL]. Our target market is [TARGET MARKET].

Please analyze the existing slides and help me improve the narrative flow and design consistency. I want to follow Khosla's emotional storytelling principles and Sequoia's systematic structure.
```

**Content Creation:**
```
Based on @startup-context/narrative.md, create a compelling problem slide that:
- Follows the 5-second rule (immediate emotional impact)
- Uses specific, relatable examples
- Sets up the urgency for our solution
- Maintains the existing design system from @src/slides/Slide01.tsx
```

**Design Consistency:**
```
Look at @src/slides/Slide05.tsx and create a similar slide for our market sizing data. 

Keep the same:
- Color scheme and typography
- Layout patterns and spacing
- Visual hierarchy and component structure

But update the content to show [SPECIFIC MARKET DATA].
```

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

**Iterative Refinement:**
```
I've created the first draft of my traction slide. Please:
1. Analyze it against Khosla's principles for emotional impact
2. Suggest improvements for visual hierarchy
3. Ensure the metrics tell a compelling growth story
4. Maintain consistency with the design system from other slides
```

**Content Extraction:**
```
From @startup-context/supporting-docs/[DOCUMENT], extract the key points for a competitive analysis slide. 

Structure it as:
- Clear differentiation points
- Visual comparison table
- Compelling narrative about our unique advantages
- Professional design matching @src/slides/Slide10.tsx
```

**Narrative Flow:**
```
Review slides 8-12 and ensure they flow logically:
- Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Market â†’ Traction â†’ Business Model

Suggest reordering or content changes to improve the story arc. Each slide should build anticipation for the next.
```

### Pro Tips for Better Results

- Use @ references: `@startup-context/narrative.md` for context, `@src/slides/Slide05.tsx` for design patterns
- Be specific: Instead of "make it better," specify what you want improved
- Reference methodologies: Mention Khosla, Sequoia, or specific principles
- Iterate in cycles: Build â†’ analyze â†’ improve â†’ expand
- Keep context: Reference previous slides for consistency

## First Step: Prepare Your Business Context

Before you start building slides, you need to prepare your business context. This is the most critical step that determines the quality of your AI-generated presentation.

### Why Context Preparation Comes First

- AI Limitation: The AI can only work with the information you provide
- Quality Impact: Better context = more compelling, specific slides
- Time Saver: Context preparation significantly reduces slide iteration time

### What You Need to Prepare

The `startup-context/` folder contains templates for:

1. `narrative.md` - Your core business story
2. `market-research.md` - Industry data and customer insights  
3. `competitive-analysis.md` - Strategic positioning vs. competitors
4. `financial-projections.md` - Revenue model and forecasts

**Pro Tip: Include Your Internal Documents**  
Beyond the templates, you can add any internal business documents to dramatically improve AI output quality:

- **Product Documents**: PRDs (Product Requirements Documents), technical specifications, roadmaps
- **Strategic Documents**: Business plans, strategic memos, partnership agreements
- **Marketing Materials**: Blog posts, press releases, case studies, white papers
- **UX Content**: Website copy, product landing pages, in-app messaging, user onboarding flows
- **Customer Materials**: Sales decks, customer success stories, testimonials, support documentation
- **Financial Documents**: Investor updates, board decks, detailed financial models

The AI will reference these documents when creating slides, resulting in more specific, authentic, and compelling content that reflects your actual business rather than generic templates.

Quick Start: At minimum, complete your `narrative.md` with real business details. This single file will dramatically improve your slide quality.

Detailed Guide: See [Preparing Your Startup Context](#preparing-your-startup-context) section below for comprehensive instructions.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Cursor Editor with Claude Sonnet for optimal AI assistance
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- GitHub account (for deployment)

### 1. Get Started

Fork and clone this repository:
```bash
# Fork this repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your development server will start at `http://localhost:5173` - keep this running to see changes in real-time.

### 2. Set Up Your Business Context

This step determines the quality of your AI-generated slides. The better your context, the better your pitch deck.

The `startup-context/` folder structure is already created with templates. Simply customize the template files with your business information.

Essential files to create (see [Startup Context Setup](startup-context/README.md) for templates):
- `startup-context/narrative.md` - Your core business story (MUST HAVE)
- `startup-context/supporting-docs/market-research.md` - Market data and customer research
- `startup-context/supporting-docs/competitive-analysis.md` - Competitor intelligence
- `startup-context/supporting-docs/financial-projections.md` - Revenue model and forecasts

Replace example assets:
- `src/assets/` - Add your logos, team photos, and company images

### 3. Build Your Slides with AI

Open Cursor Agent (`Ctrl/Cmd + L`) and start with context-setting prompts:

```
I'm building a pitch deck for [YOUR COMPANY]. Please analyze the existing slide structure and help me customize it for my business using the methodologies in the .cursor/rules/ folder.
```

Then iterate slide by slide:
```
Create a compelling problem slide based on @startup-context/narrative.md that follows Khosla's 5-second rule and matches the design system from @src/slides/Slide01.tsx
```

### 4. Deploy Your Presentation

Set up GitHub Pages (one-time):
- Go to your repository settings: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME/settings/pages`
- Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
- Save

**Note**: No gh-pages branch setup needed! The workflow handles everything automatically.

Deploy when ready:
```bash
# Make sure all changes are committed and pushed
git add .
git commit -m "Update slides"
git push origin master

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (triggers GitHub Actions)
npm run deploy
```

Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`

**Deployment Method**: Uses GitHub Actions workflow with manual trigger - no gh-pages branch needed!

## Preparing Your Startup Context

The quality of your pitch deck depends entirely on the business context you provide to the AI. This section is crucial for success.

### Why Context Matters

- AI Limitation: The AI can only work with the information you provide
- Garbage In, Garbage Out: Poor context = generic, unconvincing slides
- Quality Context: Specific, detailed business information = compelling, professional slides

### Essential Context Files

#### 1. Core Narrative (`startup-context/narrative.md`)

Purpose: Single source of truth for your business story  
AI Impact: Referenced in every slide creation

Must Include:
- Specific problem with quantified pain points
- Your unique solution and competitive advantages
- Target market with real size data (not "billions of people")
- Business model with actual pricing
- Traction with real numbers and customer names
- Team background and why you'll win
- Funding ask and specific use of funds

Quality Test: Can someone understand your business and why it matters quickly?

#### 2. Market Research (`supporting-docs/market-research.md`)

Purpose: Industry data and customer insights  
AI Impact: Used for market sizing, customer segments, and validation slides

Must Include:
- TAM/SAM/SOM with sources and calculation methods
- Customer interviews and pain point validation
- Industry statistics with credible sources
- Pricing sensitivity and willingness to pay data
- Buying process and decision criteria

Quality Test: Would an investor trust your market analysis?

#### 3. Competitive Analysis (`supporting-docs/competitive-analysis.md`)

Purpose: Strategic positioning vs. alternatives  
AI Impact: Used for competitive slides and differentiation messaging

Must Include:
- Direct competitors with honest strengths/weaknesses
- Indirect competitors and status quo alternatives
- Your unfair advantages and defensible moats
- Win/loss analysis from real sales situations
- Competitive positioning messages

Quality Test: Do you have a clear, defensible competitive position?

#### 4. Financial Projections (`supporting-docs/financial-projections.md`)

Purpose: Revenue model and growth forecasts  
AI Impact: Used for business model, traction, and funding slides

Must Include:
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- Historical financials if available
- 3-year projections with key assumptions
- Scenario analysis (base, upside, downside)
- Funding requirements and use of funds

Quality Test: Can you defend every number and assumption?

### Content Quality Standards

#### Good Context Examples

- "1.24M small businesses face succession crisis annually, with 70% shutting down vs. selling" (specific, sourced)
- "Our enterprise customers pay $50K annually vs. $200K for traditional solutions" (quantified value prop)
- "Interviewed 47 potential customers, 89% said they'd pay $500/month for this solution" (validated demand)

#### Poor Context Examples

- "Millions of businesses have this problem" (vague, unsourced)
- "We're 10x better than competitors" (unsubstantiated claim)
- "Huge market opportunity" (generic, no specifics)

### Context Validation Checklist

### Troubleshooting

#### Deployment Issues

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed:
brew install gh         # macOS
# or download from: https://github.com/cli/cli

# Authenticate GitHub CLI:
gh auth login           # Follow authentication prompts

# If deploy fails, ensure working directory is clean:
git status              # Check current status
git add .               # Stage all changes  
git commit -m "message" # Commit changes
git push origin master  # Push to remote
npm run deploy          # Then deploy
```

#### Development Issues

```bash
# If npm run dev fails:
npm install             # Reinstall dependencies
npm run dev -- --port 3000  # Try different port
```

**Changes not reflecting**: Hard refresh (`Ctrl+F5` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) or clear browser cache

#### GitHub CLI Issues

```bash
# Check GitHub CLI status:
gh auth status          # Verify authentication

# Re-authenticate if needed:
gh auth logout
gh auth login

# Check workflow trigger:
gh run list --workflow="deploy.yml" --limit 3
```

#### Removing Redacted Content

Problem: Some slides have redacted content (background and text same color) from the example presentation.  
Solution: Use this AI prompt to restore normal content:

```
I notice this slide has redacted content where the background and text colors are the same, making text invisible. Please:

1. Remove all redacted styling (background colors matching text colors)
2. Replace the Lorem ipsum placeholder text with proper content based on @startup-context/narrative.md
3. Ensure all text is clearly visible with proper contrast
4. Maintain the slide's visual design and layout structure
5. Follow Khosla's principles for clear, compelling messaging

Make the slide professional and readable while keeping the existing design system.
```
