well good afternoon everybody if we can settle down I warn you ahead of time this will
0:13
go at a blistering pace so I'll walk you through how to present to
0:22
ACS this is roughly the agenda what are the axioms what does
0:28
prep involve too many people skip that step what's the narrative arc of your
0:34
storytelling and that's sort of the crux of it uh so you you you'll see each of
0:42
these so starting with axioms first
0:49
prep properly before they start a presentation here's the big advantage of
0:56
doing prep right you team can get on the same page it's
1:02
shocking how often different parts of a management team will give very different
1:09
answers and if you're inconsistent between team members it's really bad
1:14
signs so just preparing the things I will talk about is really important it's
1:22
also a great time for the team to express its doubts and like what if that
1:29
happens or what if that there's lots of hidden ideas that are risks for your
1:35
business you either discover them very early by getting the team to talk about it or you discover them late as you're
1:42
halfway through your startup so there must be a culture of
1:48
speaking up in the team this is probably the most important piece of culture it's why Andy Grove went away
1:56
from formally dressed people and reserved parking slots so engineers
2:01
would speak up in front of executives and he said exact ties because it means
2:08
implied authority so every anxiety in the team
2:13
encourage them to surface it what if that's a problem really important to get
2:19
all these things and it will get the team on the same page the number of times after
2:25
going through a thorough process people have come to me and said we really actually understand our business
2:31
better just for internal purposes it's amazing so one of my favorite authors
2:39
speak spoken at this conference before is Margaret Hefren
2:44
she has a TED talk called Dare to Degree Disagree she has a couple of books I
2:50
highly recommend reading about how to get this culture of people within the company speaking up because almost all
2:57
the risks you'll run into somebody's thinking about it
3:04
whether they have the courage to speak to the founder or the senior management or the CEO is what's missing
3:12
keep in mind investors have only two emotions fear and greed if you keep that
3:19
in mind and address both you'll be
3:24
uh in the right place as logical as things sound almost
3:30
all investors make emotional decisions and then they use logic to explain their
3:36
decision almost always the explanation comes after the emotional
3:42
decision so keep things simple u I'll talk more about it generally complexity
3:51
induces fear and the more you try and explain the nuances especially early in your
3:58
pitch to investors the more you will scare them away i don't want to deal with this complexity
4:08
everything you do you're being judged by an investor if you hide things they will
4:14
say "I don't trust this person." The number of times this comes up u is
4:21
important you get to the point how clear a thinker are you it becomes so evident
4:26
after a presentation way more than in entrepreneurs ever figure it's it's
4:33
evident whether they're clear thinker or not so be clear and I'll get to more of
4:39
this later one of the critical questions they ask is even if you have a great startup
4:45
if you can't raise money in the future they're stuck as an investor with you so
4:50
they're judging all these aspects of whether you'll build a successful comp
4:55
company in many areas this last bullet is the reason investors are passing on
5:02
opportunities so you have to convince them you'll be able to do it better so this notion of confidence but
5:11
transparency becomes really really
5:17
important here's an important one you say something and I have a blog on this the
5:24
message sent what you're saying is not often the message
5:29
received you they are filtering it through their vernacular they're filtering it through
5:36
their recent experiences and you have no visibility into that so the more homework you do
5:45
the better that's where you need to know your
5:51
audience and what they value so do homework on the investor what have
5:58
they done recently what do they like don't like don't look at things they did five or 10 years ago because they will
6:04
have changed and of course if an investor
6:09
feels spun a little thing we had a recent case where somebody described a
6:15
$500 billion market which was okay it just wasn't five billion it may have been 10 billion
6:23
and it would have been more than sufficient but the worst thing was when
6:28
they were asked this question and the presentation got hung up on this they
6:33
tried to explain why it was 500 billion instead of saying well at least the 10
6:39
billion is direct market for us instead of trying to defend something that wasn't
6:45
true so meters is the first thing investors
6:50
judge and they are better at judging it because they hear so many
6:58
pitches so don't be flippant with the numbers so what's your
7:03
goal after your presentation somebody will write a takeaway something like
7:09
this the details here don't matter you don't need to read it uh but they will
7:15
write a takeaway email and everything you're doing during the presentation is to engineer this
7:22
takeaway keep that in mind you're getting them to write down what's good
7:27
or bad about you and hopefully it's the way you want to express it paul you
7:33
don't have to try and read it um I'll come back to font size in presentations
7:41
i have real strong beliefs you make some things not readable on purpose uh so
7:49
their thought process is pretty simple i won't spend time i'll talk about each of
7:54
these uh directly this is logical order
8:02
and keep in mind you'll have a sponsoring partner and you're really trying to help him engineer that
8:09
takeaway that he can then sell to his other partners people don't think about
8:15
this that partner is going to be selling and defending your in this investment to
8:21
others keep that in mind so what does prep involve
8:33
identify the pros and cons of your business if you don't identify the cons the investors will make up stuff on the
8:40
cons so I'm a big fan of disclosing it what are the reasons to invest or not
8:46
invest and get the team on the same page a misaligned team is often a reason for
8:53
a retraction if they're talking to multiple people in your team start with all the reasons to invest and
9:00
again you don't need to read this but there's three to five LS you have to have to get them to want to do
9:09
this this is great example the largest ever deployment of patientf facing
9:15
agentic AI and a map to illustrate it
9:22
clinical validation start to take away start to entice them with why this
9:29
is different here's what an investor is
9:35
looking for will you get the next round at an up valuation so your objective is to derisk
9:43
what it takes in each stage of company it's different and I won't go into what
9:49
uh it takes to do this in each of these companies each each of these stages but
9:55
be clear what it takes to get the next round and that's your objectives and I'll come back to
10:02
it equally important get in front of the
10:07
risks directly address the investor's fears if you don't they'll make it up
10:14
themselves you don't get a say in that and you can prepare contingency
10:20
plans for your risks so many entrepreneurs are afraid to address their risk uh it's like sticking your
10:28
hand in the head in the sand it won't go away and investors know
10:34
that you can also defang each of the reasons
10:40
one of the things in mental health it's just another chatbot a hundred people have
10:45
it but you can turn a negative into a positive by saying it's the only
10:51
clinically evaluated and approved by X-regulatory body this is how you defang
10:57
and I won't go through each of these uh concerns
11:05
so even acknowledging the risk is a good idea this is one of my
11:12
favorite slides from the original Square deck jack started with 140 reasons to
11:18
not invest why this might fail and he talked to a couple but it
11:25
really made you like him and say "I want to invest with this guy he's thinking
11:31
through all the reasons Write down the objections and I
11:38
apologize I'm going super fast but I have a simple message on each
11:43
slide and every time you meet with a new investor they come up with reasons they
11:50
worry about or the hard questions they ask add them to your list of hard questions and find answers for them when
11:58
a future investor asks i'll come back to this near the end develop all the burning questions
12:05
again you're not meant to read this and keep adding to them but then you start with your 30
12:13
secondond commercial have a clear
12:19
reason this is one it can be textual this is too much i
12:26
would use this in words when starting the presentation not in
12:32
writing but you can have visual reasons
12:40
also here's the last part uh the next part the narrative art storytelling is
12:47
what people will listen to it's not the logical reasons
12:53
unfortunately so you will have to budget your presentation you should be
12:59
relatively complete but completeness is not as important as telling a great
13:06
story and the way to do that and I always encourage people to take the
13:11
reasons to invest and the reasons not to invest write them in a word document not
13:17
a slide document as headlines the headlines alone should
13:24
tell a complete story like I want to be an investor in this if this is true this
13:30
is without a single slide just the headlines and it should look something like this again not meant to be read but
13:37
you go through the 20 and you say I want to invest as an investor if this is not right nothing
13:45
you do on the slides will matter and this is truly about through
13:51
English literature storytelling and writing this is not about logical
13:58
completeness if you need to omit things for that need for completeness omit them
14:04
if they interfere with the narrative arc this is
14:09
example the headline is everything frankly all the graphics just
14:15
distract from the headline the headline is the reason
14:21
so this is a much better way of saying the same thing because your eyes were
14:26
wondering what to look at and for an investor make it easy make it low
14:32
cognitive load to look at this and frankly this is even better even without
14:38
this graphic this is another example of same company you don't know where to look
14:45
that's a bad sign this is a way to say there's three
14:51
terowatts of clean energy globally a much simpler way not a lot of reading
14:57
not a lot of cognitive load this is another way to explain uh a
15:04
simple idea even this has too many words and graphics for me so I'll come back to this idea of
15:12
simplifying don't subvert your story in the service of logical
15:18
order people go logically you'll have all these slides in this video so
15:26
u this is a mistake often made by entrepreneurs they get into the nitty-gritty that's boring that takes
15:33
away from the excitement of I really think this is tempting and I'm lord and I want to
15:42
invest follow the story not the completeness put everything else in the
15:48
appendex and I'll come back to why the appendix is important brevity is really really
16:01
important this simple explanation of how you
16:08
start and you're really saying if I can at the beginning if I can prove
16:14
X then you should want to invest and your last slide should be did
16:20
I prove X to you that's the narrative arc
16:31
There's many many reasons to invest and you have to figure out your own but go
16:38
through that and you have to convince people on the fear side greed comes before fear on the fear side that you
16:46
know how to handle the risks
16:52
this is my point and that's the key
16:59
takeaway start with the big headline at scale will be Glideways will
17:05
be the most cost effective mass transit system in the world which is what cities
17:11
want now they have a bunch of numbers down here and I'll come back to these numbers but they're pretty damn good
17:18
reasons this could be your reason to invest you could start here even if it's
17:24
out of order and then say if I can prove this this is a good investment for
17:33
you this is another one
17:39
something bold that tempts investors and
17:49
simple and then your job is to prove that you can do this and you can handle
17:56
the risks this is an example of something that is trying to say something
18:03
important but it gets lost in the details too many different things more
18:09
data less emotion much better way to save the thing if we detected early
18:16
emergence of disease and stopped in its tracks would you want to
18:22
invest that's the way to explain it not the previous way
18:29
and if you're five minutes into a presentation the investor doesn't know what you're doing you're completely
18:41
sunk it really has to be simple and compelling you're doing one presentation
18:47
you worked on it for a month you sweated over it in that month the investors heard 30
18:57
presentations they don't want the cognitive load of figuring out whether they should be
19:04
interested start with the basics start like you're talking to kindergartens and make it increasingly more
19:10
complex because they want to know you
19:17
understand jargon is the worst thing and people assume the investor knows your
19:23
jargon they don't it's not among the 30 business plans they looked at
19:32
recently each slide moving on to the next bullet should be a
19:39
message it shouldn't be a topic we just created the highest temperature
19:45
fully simulated EGS reservoir in the world with some very fancy looking
19:50
pictures this detail on the side can be there but it really distracts from the
19:56
key message the message is at the top and the pictures are no cognitive load
20:02
stay visceral think about it viscerally i think of it as left hook right hook
20:10
punch him in the face with every single slide an emotional
20:16
punch sizzle does matters and simplicity matters but clarity on the messages
20:24
matters it's the narrative arc of storytelling and hooking a
20:30
viewer that's important i showed you one slide from the square
20:36
deck a year later I called one of our associates and said "Why the heck did we
20:42
invest uh can you get me the deck from a year ago?" And he sent me this message
20:48
the square deck absolute seduction there wasn't enough meat to
20:54
really have invested but the seduction seduced us
21:02
that's what you're trying to achieve so this is one way to think about it my favorite on any slide is the 5-second
21:10
test put the slide up in front of a viewer that doesn't know your business is a smart investor another entrepreneur
21:19
and take it down what do they say the message is five seconds if they can't tell you what the
21:26
message is your slide is way too complex
21:33
so often when you put up a slide the viewer's eyes are wondering which element which graphic which text should
21:40
I look at that's a losing proposition destroys the
21:47
storytelling if a element in a slide doesn't convey something and I'll give you some
21:54
examples you really should take it out and one message per slide don't try
22:01
and do two you can in fact have more slides and go faster and I'm going
22:07
pretty damn fast um if your message is simple and it's less cognitive load i'll
22:15
give you some examples less is more is so
22:20
important no gratuitous graphics or distractions
22:26
so this is script um there was a psychology test where they described a task and then
22:34
changed the font from clean simple font to script and
22:42
asked the viewers to estimate how long this task was how difficult it would
22:48
be going to script doubled the estimated time to do the same task in the same
22:54
words why because it was more cognitive load that's how human brains are that's
23:01
what you ought to keep in mind keep it simple so make everything punchy think
23:09
of a punch every single time you put a word down there's no simple jabs just a
23:15
punch a left hook and a right hook uh that's how I think of presentations
23:20
and graphics only come when they add something if you saw my presentation
23:26
this morning it was no more than five to 10 words per slide and very crisp they
23:34
don't have to be complete sentences so take this 4x more wallet share than
23:39
unsecured credit cards that's an important clear message what does the
23:45
graphic do illustrate the same but isn't this a better way to do it
23:51
in 5 seconds isn't this message clearer even though the other one has more
23:57
data that's what I mean here graphics
24:04
actually add to the story so sometimes they're warranted aging is the n number
24:10
one risk factor for chronic disease and you're sort of showing a graphic that goes up
24:16
exponentially this is storytelling this is another
24:24
example really bad way to explain really powerful messages so take something
24:32
out this is simpler 1.6 billion people have a
24:38
diagnosible mental illness and 70% of people with mental illness will receive
24:46
no treatment now that's powerful this got lost and I would argue you can still
24:53
reduce it further and the big message on the first
24:59
slide really was we are scaling AI therapists and that got completely lost
25:04
how many people got that message nobody picked it up because your eyes were wandering from graphic to
25:12
graphic don't do that
25:17
and this was the key message we can do clinical staffing for all the people who are not getting
25:23
mental health by having AI therapists it's such a powerful
25:31
message this is another slide from the same deck apologies
25:38
uh complex the message is getting lost
25:43
what's the message we can do intake we can do triage and assessment and we can
25:48
do therapy we can do all parts of mental health but that got lost in the previous
25:55
slide more less is more this is another
26:01
one powerful messages it's pretty clear but this is
26:09
clearer nothing like 96% week-over-week
26:16
growth that message got lost in the previous
26:24
slide this is one of my favorites simple way to convey a
26:30
message this is emotion this is
26:37
visceral so you got that visceral illustration when you're talking about
26:42
organ age this is way more powerful than any
26:48
words you could use so after your headlines are done and
26:54
the story is written decide when you need to add text
27:00
mostly decide not to and then pick every word and try and
27:07
delete it and say what does it take away when you delete a word or a graphic
27:13
sentences don't have to be complete I even hate periods I anything that
27:19
distracts is a bad idea in breaking that narrative that visceral engagement with
27:26
the story put things on single lines
27:36
So the body of your slides let me get to
27:41
that you notice I have a marker for you where in the story that I laid out on
27:47
the purple slide I am that's important to reorient people
27:52
because they haven't seen your presentation they don't know the sequence
27:58
and always look at where people's eyes go first and does the slide meet the 5-second
28:04
rule don't clutter your slides don't go to the edges all that adds to cognitive
28:10
load if there aren't enough clear space on the sides it'll be perceived as more
28:16
different difficult even if it's
28:22
not i made this point delete everything you can
28:28
also superlatives are not proof always show don't tell you've
28:34
heard that before but the number of people who have things like worldclass
28:40
team and then they show a not so interesting
28:46
team if you have a not so interesting team what do you do you say "Here's the
28:54
team I want to build." when we have the funding to build it that's perfectly
28:59
okay you're being honest you don't have to say you have a great team just say
29:05
you can't afford it but you will afford it once you have funding there's a reason to get funding instead of
29:12
pretending you have a world-class team
29:18
so I've already said this lots of white space reduce complexity one bullet per line there's
29:26
some rules here that you can study on your
29:32
own you get the idea here's another
29:40
slide what do you get out of it your eyes are wondering like what's the
29:46
message here much simple we do superhuman
29:52
diagnostics we have a graph to prove it this got lost how many people picked up
29:58
that they did superhuman diagnostics and superhuman
30:04
therapy and we are learning and improving these messages got completely
30:09
lost on one slide because you tried to put three messages on one slide and you can go much faster in your
30:18
deck if you have fixed amount of time it's not a fixed number of slides it's a fixed amount of time and with simpler
30:26
messages people get it so you can go faster this is another example of a bad
30:32
slide some pretty interesting things if you read the text but gets
30:42
lost the message is on the left the Ftune 500 lose combined 31 billion on
30:50
employees failing to share knowledge effectively now you framed what you do automatically
30:57
by stating the problem and you can have details on the
31:02
right or skip
31:09
them this is a clear way of saying your initial wedge is a digital twin for
31:14
every employee and this is a way of enticing
31:21
them what if your digital twin is around long after the employee has left this is continuity of knowledge
31:29
these are much more effective ways of saying what was said
31:37
earlier i can't emphasize this enough this is another
31:44
slide i don't know it doesn't do anything for me i don't know where to look what to read
31:51
too complex it's much simpler and tells you what you're
31:57
doing human organs can dramatically increase supply and reduce the weight
32:03
list better even better something emotional organs can save valuable
32:10
lives that's all you need to say if you're doing organs
32:19
same company i don't know uh what to make of
32:24
this slide deeply technical and this should be in the appendex the details are
32:30
important and I'll come back to the appendex this is a way of saying the
32:36
organ is better but again the graphics makes it get lost clear example of too many messages
32:44
much better to have one graphic that says our survival is higher than an FDA
32:50
approved therapy that's what matters that says you should be
32:56
interested and you can do the diligence
33:03
later this says we are executing in a complex
33:09
area one clear message this is my favorite really complex area like fusion
33:17
explained so simply even a viewer who doesn't understand fusion can say this makes
33:24
sense i'll figure out the rest this is worth learning
33:31
about it's a complicated deep tech message that makes it look simple
33:42
so I can't emphasize enough this idea of
33:47
remove anything extra this is the message about weather
33:55
forecasting but what do you see the key messages get lost a thousandx data advantage a
34:03
thousandx compute advantage did you get that from the slide
34:12
better easier to read this is much more clearer statement
34:19
our smart balloons with a thousandx data advantage but the next slide is one of
34:25
my favorites shows a map of the world with thousands of balloons 5x more data than
34:32
the rest of the world combined each dot is a single balloon i don't need to say
34:38
anything else i have a huge advantage this is the emotional way to express it
34:45
everybody gets this and this is the follow on slide
34:52
here's the path of,200 different balloons we've launched it's basically saying we cover the world without saying
35:00
it that's why we have more data than the rest of the world combined
35:06
this is an actual presentation i love high signal to clutter ratio can't
35:15
emphasize is enough your fonts matter your colors
35:20
matter i obsess about every word every spacing uh to the chagrin of many
35:30
people this is okay
35:36
real world real time brain imaging but you don't know where I needs to
35:41
focus it's okay much better here's what we
35:47
do i can skip past this slide after five seconds and you'll know what my device
35:54
looks like and how you use it and suddenly the brain imaging method
36:01
message is very clear we can image your brain these are complex ideas conveyed
36:12
simply again budgeting is for completeness but doesn't trump the
36:19
narrative so you should budget your presentation i'm going to skip through
36:25
these relatively fast
36:35
sex appeal is more important than technical accuracy as long as the
36:41
technical accuracy is there in the appendex and the details are there after
36:46
you've convinced somebody it's worth going through the appendex and the details and spending investing the extra
36:52
time because they already want to invest otherwise I get lazy
36:59
this again from Square simple idea of what's missing in
37:04
today's payments immediiacy transparency
37:10
approachability there's no confusing the message of what the value proposition of square
37:16
is most people would make this slide so complex jack did a masterful job of that
37:24
here's an example of complexity
37:31
this is a much simpler way of stating it the benefit and only the benefit is
37:41
stated and it changes the narrative on geothermal as
37:50
energy organ shortage you saw that complex verbiage
37:57
before 41,000 transplants 106 people on the weight list million people with
38:03
weight stage disease this is an even better way of
38:09
oops I'm on the wrong button uh it shows you the magnitude of the
38:17
problem by the way this is a circle that gets lost
38:22
that's how many people with 44 million people with chronic kidney
38:28
disease this is the better way of saying it of the 106,000 people on the wait
38:35
list only 40% will receive a kidney the
38:40
rest is our opportunity that's how I would state it
38:48
this is another way to show in fusion why the competition is way more complex than me you don't need to understand
38:55
fusion know that this is much simpler what others are doing that's the only
39:01
message you're going to convey to a non-technical
39:07
investor this is another example less than 1% of the cells we need can be
39:15
reliably produced this is about stem cell
39:21
differentiation it's clearly stated the problem is clearly understood
39:29
very quickly in 5 seconds
39:36
the search base is unfathomably large is the key message unless you do it our way
39:42
which is the implied statement here uh
39:52
oops there's an important message here with the same company current methods
39:57
cannot economically scale but this key message and I should
40:03
have gone in sequence gets lost it would take a 100 million wells
40:12
these are biology pipetting applications to do this task to generate enough data
40:22
better way to state it instead of a 100 million wells we can do it in 400 wells
40:29
we have a data advantage in generating a model a foundation model for this and I
40:36
would even simplify it
40:43
further keep remembering what you're trying to convey keep remembering those
40:49
headlines telling a story
40:54
and keep connecting into emotion and greed if you want an investor interested
41:00
how will they make more money is the only question they're mostly
41:12
asking uh the number of things that start with
41:17
numbers it's not only the numbers are it tells me the entrepreneur isn't
41:24
thinking clearly about what's important who cares about a 4 trillion
41:29
healthcare spend market it's in at least half the healthcare decks I see that
41:34
same statement and it doesn't mean anything what does it mean to the
41:41
billion dollar of revenue you're trying to generate it's too large a number to
41:47
matter every single inch of a slide is valuable real estate so treat it that way and blank is
41:56
better than clutter so always ask what does it do for
42:07
you so this is that old thing this 500 billion number again sees
42:16
feels like even though in this case it isn't the case but if you state
42:21
it as since 67% of patients needing therapy don't receive it real demand is
42:28
500 billion now that's a better way to make a very large number not sound like
42:39
this is saying you're building a foundry for manufacturing cells it's
42:45
okay you take detail away and it becomes clearer number of scientists needed per
42:52
year for manual production to treat 10,000 patients much simpler when you put less
42:59
detail there that's the key message the way we do it currently you need too many
43:05
scientists and they can do just one patient a month per scientist that's a clear statement of
43:12
the problem um this is another example of a
43:17
different company important
43:22
message but a number of important things get lost the 90 billion spent on failed
43:29
drugs gets lost that you're trying to make trials
43:34
higher probability of success gets lost
43:45
this is another example of glide waves you get lots of numbers but the
43:52
key message gets lost you can do bottoms up numbers when
43:59
the numbers seem too large to be credible but here this key message of it's worth
44:05
250 million per mile lifetime value gets completely
44:14
lost this is a better way of saying 215 million per mile and if the investor
44:22
challenges you you're gold because you have details in the appendex on why this
44:28
is true because it sounds implausible 250 million per mile turns out they get
44:33
50-year contracts so there's there's revenue per mile for 50 years exclusive
44:39
contract so you get to explain your advantages if you hook the investor into asking you this
44:49
question i'm going to try and move a little bit faster here
44:55
um focus on your advantages and the unfair advantages
45:01
restate them whether it's IP or some unit economics or clever strategy there
45:06
can be lots of reasons this is an example of a robust IP portfolio but
45:15
again this little message a robust IP portfolio is better done differently
45:21
right at the The details don't matter what patents you have they'll get to later they'll
45:27
hire an IP attorney you just want to have them hire an IP attorney to ask the
45:33
question then you get to go through the details this is one where detail
45:39
actually matters here's the five things we have
45:45
that make us unbeatable that's a clear message and so
45:51
sometimes details actually
45:56
help but this is a much bolder
46:03
statement much clearer still more data than needs to be on there
46:12
this is a very clear statement that one of the most
46:19
efficient credit card companies in the world and compares it to the
46:25
best
46:30
right same company you see these graphs and the focus is on less than 12 month
46:36
payback but the key message I bet none of you got was they
46:43
have 40x greater revenue per user than the other guy 40x and that got
46:51
lost and I'm giving you real examples of how you have to say what are you trying
46:56
to say with each slide same
47:02
idea again too much complexity
47:08
we're really trying to answer these questions but to be honest this is a much simpler way and much more powerful
47:15
way of saying
47:21
this another example three messages and again the key
47:27
gets lost
47:35
it asks the right question simply what makes an ideal human testing pipeline
47:41
many human tissue types massive AI scale throughput exceptional robotic
47:50
consistency way easier and faster to get through these slides than the original
47:56
slide which will just confuse investors you could even make it more
48:03
powerful that's how I would have phrased
48:12
it so when you don't have advantages you
48:18
can be transparent show how clever you are how you will build an
48:24
advantage because nobody has advantages when they start they have hypothetical
48:29
advantages but again being transparent says you're
48:37
thoughtful risks are key they show you you understand your
48:46
business trying to gloss over them says you haven't thought about your business
48:57
clear statement of why a separate device is needed because the biggest question is do you need a device other than your
49:03
phone right or wrong they're addressing it up front and then trying to convince
49:08
an investor that makes sense it's addressing the elephant in
49:14
the room
49:21
so the more you address risks I think the better investors think you're capable of building a successful
49:33
startup this is another way of handling risk this was an actual slide we
49:39
basically said even if we fail at Fusion we'll have the most powerful magnet company which is worth billions of
49:45
dollars that was the actual excuse we used for our first round in fusion
49:50
because everybody assumed fusion was not possible said fine we still have
49:55
something really valuable because nobody else can build a 20 Tesla magnet we can use it in nuclear medicine
50:03
we can use it in wind turbines we can use it in lots of places that have nothing to do with fusion that's a
50:09
different kind of d-risking those are offramps
50:18
so I can't emphasize enough if you're pitching to me versus David Widen you're
50:24
going to do a very you should do a very different pitch we have different priorities that we get lowered
50:31
by so
50:36
understand how to do it and if you are a technical startup
50:44
and have technical risk you have to prove you have lower market risk there's no risk in the market for fusion if you
50:50
solve it it is trillions of dollars and the framing is I have an off-ramp it
50:57
doesn't work if it works we got a home run beyond any home run
51:02
scene and each series there's increasing specificity
51:07
and more risks eliminated that's how investors think about it that's how you should think about it what do you risk
51:14
with each
51:24
series so think about the segments in your market because you want to prove
51:30
you can be successful in some segment before you're successful in the whole
51:36
thing that's derisking where can you find an easier path to get
51:44
to base camp on the way to Mount Everest this is a bad way of explaining
51:50
value you see many examples of these and I'm illustrating them because they're
51:55
incredibly common in entrepreneurial
52:00
decks the business model gets lost what's the key message here
52:08
um let me go back that there's clinical trials revenue which is
52:13
smaller there's downstream value in deployment but that comes much later
52:20
either way we have a way to
52:26
start this is a much better way of explaining we go after large new
52:33
co-brands and then we go for conversions where in so it's explaining the
52:39
different types of things one has more card holders the other has more
52:45
loans and and segmenting is important
52:57
what's special about your team i hate slides like this that say
53:03
founders it's not a message it's not saying anything this is a team from Thumptac
53:10
that is scaled to big business say something like successful
53:16
founders have scaled Thumptac to three billion in valuation i got lost in that
53:21
slide real strength that got lost this is another one way too many people too many
53:28
founders want to include all their team well that doesn't say anything for do
53:33
anything for the investor you're trying to be inclusive that's a really bad
53:41
idea could put it in the appendix but pictures don't say anything why the team
53:46
is appropriate for your task and who on the team is critical to your task is
53:52
what matters another really strong team the message completely gets
54:01
lost what are the key points about this team that's going to be relevant to what you're
54:09
building founders introduction the key message is at the bottom
54:18
making a headline that says the team is appropriate for this task much better way to say what the team is why the
54:27
team and that you're thoughtful about the team this is another better way to
54:35
say that got completely lost talent density is the message here
54:44
there's reasonably good message i would have taken out all the graphics on the right doesn't add anything it's a good
54:53
team this is another way of expressing the
54:59
story it's part of storytelling and I like this format
55:05
because it says I've done this conversational interfaces before
55:12
so it says the team is appropriate for the
55:19
task financials stadium clearly not too much detail not too
55:25
little cash flow revenue that's what people care
55:31
about limit the number of rows and columns there's just a sample
55:43
But this is much more powerful it's really saying scale drives continuously
55:48
moving economic uh improving economics like that's much more powerful than just the financials on the previous slide
56:02
it's also amazing to me people will use one number in one slide and a different number somewhere else if you aren't
56:10
consistent you're making up whatever your numbers whatever is
56:17
relevant really make sure they are consistent and you have complete
56:22
command and I'll just get to the appendex
56:31
and you can do a lot when you're early and don't have a lot to sell you can
56:37
sell how thoughtful you are about eliminating and going after all the
56:42
risks with the least amount of money that's what
56:48
investors like to see
56:56
and you may be a conceptual startup and that's fine you can change that reality but how you present it you can change
57:02
pretty
57:10
dramatically there's many ways to address competition you can keep knocking him
57:16
throughout your presentation i like that
57:22
style by the way I'm not opposed to a dedicated competition slide if it's simple to
57:28
understand a bad way to explain a slide I'll is just coming
57:34
up but if you're not acknowledging your competition people will think you're
57:39
naive so acknowledge it this is the bad example of
57:45
competition it doesn't say you're better just too much stuff to read
57:53
this is a much better way for the same company to say our competitor takes
57:59
$105,000 per discovered cancer and it takes us a
58:04
$184 now that's a powerful message and the explanation is there you
58:12
could even reduce the explanation but this is powerful and if you had that
58:19
advantage press it over and over again there's another number our competition
58:26
which is recognized by everybody has discovered 1,800 cancers we've done
58:32
50,000 at a$184 at discovered cancer i can't imagine anything more
58:40
powerful than that but in the previous slide it got
58:47
lost also important to state when you're raising money what you're going to achieve with
58:55
it bad way of saying what you're going to achieve i don't know what to make of
59:00
it sorry Paul what is the risk you're retiring by
59:07
the end of your runway that's the most important question what's this financing
59:12
for this is a clearer statement though still a lot of complexity on the staff
59:17
it says with each amount spent what am I derisking
59:24
much better though complex and seed stage is okay to
59:30
explain what you're d-risking and that you haven't spent a lot of money so you haven't derisked a lot but you have a
59:36
clear plan and finish with a flourish start
59:41
with your 30 secondond commercial finish with
59:47
it it's really powerful way to complete the story even asking have I convinced you
59:54
of this that's the
1:00:01
302 commercial so let me get to the appendex
1:00:06
and um I'm sorry I'm rushing through this uh appendex is very critical to
1:00:14
show you're prepared you've simplified the messaging along the way as I've
1:00:21
explained put all the detail in the appendix and if they don't ask you
1:00:29
questions to go to the expense appendix make an excuse because you're trying to
1:00:34
prove to them that you're prepared for any contingency i don't want I want a entrepreneur who
1:00:42
understands the key concepts but then has the detail behind it and it's all in the appendex and no matter what question
1:00:49
I ask they already have a slide having a slide in the appendix is way more
1:00:55
powerful than talking to it even if you understand it because it says you're prepared you think about
1:01:02
contingencies it's judging you again which I talked about earlier
1:01:10
and every time you get a hard question add an appendex slides so you can offer
1:01:16
it next time with that
1:01:22
detail every single meeting update your appendex with the additional hard
1:01:28
questions which brings me to the last part of what I want to
1:01:34
say beyond the appendix
1:01:44
who should you pitch most people pitch the investors
1:01:50
they want first wrong idea pitch the investors you don't want
1:01:56
first and have them poke holes in your presentation so you can your appendex
1:02:01
can grow the five least important ones
1:02:07
first you know what first you're practicing your pitch but you're also getting hard questions from people you
1:02:14
do don't really care
1:02:22
about so get to your targets after you know
1:02:27
you can fluidly pitch and you've collected all the hard questions any investor might ask what works as a
1:02:38
cell so in conclusion I want to say it's stories not facts that lure
1:02:46
investors that's the key to nailing your race thank
1:02:55
you by the way I don't know if you felt it i went through 186
1:03:01
slides but the pace didn't feel unnatural at least to me it didn't i
1:03:08
rushed through a lot we only had an hour i could have gone on for two hours but I budgeted my time and I said to myself
1:03:17
before I started I'd do three slides per minute and I tried to convey it and leave out
1:03:24
the detail that was too long to fit in three slides a minute i put a lot of
1:03:29
things in small font because I didn't want you to read it i wanted more a
1:03:34
picture of preparation than the details so either
1:03:40
make everything above 20 points of font font size so it's readable or smaller
1:03:45
than 12 so it feels like a picture thanks a lot
