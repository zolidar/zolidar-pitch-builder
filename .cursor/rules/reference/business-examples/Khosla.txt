Axioms for luring investors
What does prep involve? (& the dangers of skipping it)
The narrative arc of your storytelling (replete with hooks & lures)
Don’t subvert your story in service of logical order
How to make each slide one message, versus just a topic or many messages
Budgeting is for completeness but doesn’t trump the narrative arc

Prep pays
 Prep is an opportunity to understand your business, get
agreement among your management team, & to
understand your vulnerabilities
Get the team on the same page
Founders & teams should externalize their anxieties, sticking
points, uncertainties & dreads
To do the prep correctly, there must be a culture of
speaking up & pushback

“Forget the pecking order at work” and “Dare to Disagree”
- Margaret Heffernan
Watch Heffernan’s two Ted talks here & here
Reasoning comes later to explain a decision “to invest or not invest”
90% of an investor’s decision is based on emotions and narratives
Investors bounce between fear and greed
6
Keep things simple and jargon free. Complexity induces fear 
Will you be able to raise money in the future?
 Play games or hide things and good investors will notice
Do you get to the point? Are you a clear thinker?
Investors are judging you: be confident, transparent, humble…
Investors are judging you in every way
7
Message sent is OFTEN not the message received;
8
speak their language
Each investor is different; do your homework
Know your audience and what they value!
9
10
Overselling or hiding issues in the business always
bites you later
 If the investor feels spun, you’re done
11
Don’t trigger the bullshit meter.
Many founders can exaggerate aspects of their business …
don’t be flippant with numbers or statements
Your goal: engineer the takeaways
12
Team: How impressive for the plan? What’s special in the “gene pool”?
Reasons to not invest: risk mitigation plan shows preparedness
Reasons to invest: emotional/greed reasons work better
Mission: what pain (not vitamin) does company alleviate!
Follow VCs’ thought process
13
Financials with cash flow: What milestones/risks are eliminated?
14
You’re selling the partnership, through your sponsor
VC, so give the individual partner the talking points to
overcome objections they will inevitably hear
… make the case for your sponsor and their case to the rest
of their partners by “engineering the takeaways”

The narrative arc of your storytelling (replete with hooks & lures)
Don’t subvert your story in service of logical order
How to make each slide one message, versus just a topic or many messages
Budgeting is for completeness but doesn’t trump the narrative arc
What are the reasons to invest & not invest?
With your team, identify the pros & cons of your business
Get the team aligned; often it’s not
16
Now is the time to understand your business
17
Start with ALL the Reasons to Invest
1. Largest ever clinical deployment, 400,000+ patients treated
2. 93% diagnostic accuracy in the study of 100,000 people
3. Of the 1.6 billion people with mental illness, 70% received no treatment and
have 2.3x higher costs. We are uniquely positioned to capture that
opportunity
4. We have more regulatory approvals than anybody. No one else in this
category comes close to our level of peer review, clinical rigor and impact
5. We've got 95% retention rate for customers... we make $18 to $40 every time
[the triage agent] is used
Reduce to 3-5 “lures”
18
19
20
Derisk what it takes to get to the “next round”
Seed Bet on team to deliver milestones / value inflections
Series A Prove out MVP, PMF, strong partnerships, etc
Series B Invest into growth
Get in front of the risks, and directly address investor FEAR
21
What are the reasons NOT to invest?
Prepare your contingency plans
22
Defang each reason to not invest
“It’s Just Another Chatbot” Lots of chatbots... only one that's clinically validated
and approved by X regulatory body. Plus, no other chatbot can tie to computational psychiatry
Therapist Resistance For the foreseeable future... every therapist will have five
interns or five assistants... under the supervision and under the license of therapist
Patients Might Prefer Humans They knew it wasn't human but they acknowledged
that's better therapy... got better outcomes
Unclear Payment Model There isn’t yet a mechanism... system is designed to pay
providers based on their time. But we can bend this cost curve until it snaps such that we
work outside the system.
23
Or acknowledge the reasons to not invest
“We understand the risk but the rewards are huge”
25
Write down the 10-15 hardest objections you can think
of and have Appendix slides with lots of detail
Add to the list of hard questions every time you meet
an investor
26
1. Your churn rate is high, why is that and what are you doing about it?
2. The space you operate in is fiercely competitive, how will you differentiate?
3. You have poor unit economics, how are you going to build a robust business?
4. How does the very long sales cycle impact the capital needs of the business and deal size?
5. What is your ideal customer profile and how does your go-to-market match?
6. Can you build a big business by only focusing on the long tail?
7. If you’re not unit profitable, is that by design? When will you be and what are the key levers?
8. What are you doing to de-risk the regulatory issues in your space?
9. How did you arrive at your current pricing? What are the opportunities to increase it over time?
10. Would it make more sense to focus on just one of your five revenue streams?
Develop 10 and 15 “burning questions”
investors might have … and keep adding!

Autoimmune disease is one of the biggest cost drivers in healthcare —
and we’re building the platform that will replace drug-first care with
AI-powered outcomes. 50M+ Americans live with autoimmune
conditions. Employers and payers are spending $45K+ per member
annually on biologics alone. WellTheory delivers root-cause care with
clinical outcomes, AI-driven margins, and enterprise-ready GTM. We’ve
signed big logos like HP, Red Bull, and Sentara — and they’re already
expanding. We’re raising $10–12M to scale our AI stack and
deprescription engine — unlocking massive savings and building the
category leader in autoimmune care.

Slide headlines should each be a message not a title
(“Team” is a title; “Team engineered for this opportunity” is a message)
Write the 20 slide headlines, which should make
for a compelling investment story
31
The 20 slide headlines without slide content should tell an emotional
narrative. Lay it out in a text document and see if it captures the reader!
Write the 20 slide headlines, which alone should tell
me everything I need to know
1. At a depth of 10 kilometers, the earth’s crust holds 100x more energy than all known fossil fuel reserves. Yet only 0.4% of the total U.S.
utility-scale electricity is generated from conventional geothermal energy.
2. Currently, Enhanced Geothermal is too expensive to be disruptive to the U.S. energy mix
3. SuperHot Rock (>374°C) EGS will yield 5-8x higher power per well than EGS at 200°C
4. Mazama’s approach: Create large-capacity EGS in super hot rock to harvest heat and generate cost effective power
5. Mazama Energy - Co-founded by AltaRock & Blade Energy
6. Mazama’s innovations focus on 3 key areas to develop SHR resources reliably and at reasonable cost
7. Blade’s deep (and rare) HPHT + Thermal + Geothermal engineering expertise can ensure long-term integrity of SHR wells
8. Patented super-critical CO2 Managed Pressure Drilling process can drill to high temperatures
9. Thermal Lattice can create large-capacity, durable reservoirs to enhance well productivity and recovery
10. Mazama’s technology advancements provide robust pathway to unlock the full power of cost effective SHR EGS
11. Newberry: Fully-permitted, multi-GW site for technology testing gives us a 5-year head start
12. Heat Harvester - Proprietary, Integrated Asset Management framework to forecast and optimize performance
13. Mazama’s MUSE is the synthesis of our technology advancements to drive down cost of EGS
14. Performance projections at 450°C indicate <$40 per MWh cost for a 20-year, 100 MW project
15. MUSE has the potential to become the lowest cost, Terawatt-scale, dispatchable source of carbon-free power
16. Next 12 Months: Tech Development, De-risking, and Creating a first-of-its-kind 300°C EGS at Newberry
17. Future Plans: First-of-its-kind 400°C SHR EGS pilot demo at Newberry
18. Mazama currently has rights to 200 MW at Newberry. Newberry holds 5+ GW of power potential.
19. Mazama can implement MUSE initially at 350+°C to provide power for majority of the world’s population
20. Catalyze energy transition by delivering new, clean power from Super Hot Rocks which is universal, utility-scale, and affordable. 32

Don’t subvert your story in service of logical order
How to make each slide one message, versus just a topic or many messages
Budgeting is for completeness but doesn’t trump the narrative arc
Put the rest in the Appendix
Follow the story, not “completeness”
Now that the story is written in the titles,
the rest should be easy
41
Use subtitles if needed, but brevity is important 
You can or have figured out the product market fit
Show market is big enough or new to be exciting
Show why it is awesome: “If I can prove x, then…”
Start with your 30 second “commercial teaser”
The risks are manageable & market large
You have 60-120 seconds to let investors know what you
do and why it can change the world
42
Launch right into the biggest statement you can
make but tune it to the “audience”
The message you’re sending here is if we do our job right,
we will completely change XYZ

The grand ambition and upside is
immediately clear

What if we detected early emergence
of disease and stopped it in its tracks?
Start with the basics like you're speaking to kindergartners, but advance
your arguments quickly as if they’re graduate students
Founders must make the case for their company simple & compelling
You’re sunk if an investor doesn’t know what your company does 5
minutes into your pitch

Put slide in front of viewer for 5 seconds and take it down;
what can they tell you about the message?
The 5 second test!
55
One message per slide is faster
Test every element for what it conveys!
Viewers eyes should know where to focus, not wander

57
58
Gratuitous graphics are a crutch & add distractions
Ideally, your headlines are so punchy and have such strong narrative
ability, you don’t need anything beyond them in your slides
Graphics come last and exist only in a support role for the text if they
convey a clear message or product picture or visual picture

If you do, make sure to de-word. Try to only use single lines
After your headlines are done and the story is written,
decide where you need text in the body to emphasize the
title message (and no other data/facts)
77
Remember less is more 
Examine every word, picture, bullet. Delete if not critical
Don’t go to the edges; don’t clutter or mix messages
No clutter: where does the eye go first?
Start with an agenda/hook & repeat where you are in agenda/story
Superlatives are not proof: “Show” DON’T “Tell”
Guidelines for the body of your slides
78
We have a world class team
3y investment banker

2y ML engineer at
John Deere
Principal at a16z,
ex-McKinsey
Lots of white space; reduce visual complexity
Don’t need full sentences, periods etc. Just emphasis
One line per bullet usually
No more than 4-5 lines and <30 (40 max) words per slide
All text >20pt (readable) or <13pt (not meant to be read); centered!

Slides on user problem, solution, and market
150
Connect everything back to emotion and greed of big, less

You can start with your vision for the world or the
problem you are solving … but don’t start with top down
bullshit market numbers that are not relevant like “$4
trillion of Healthcare spend”
151

VCs like data-driven founders. They like the fact you test and
are thesis-driven
If you are really early, and don’t have financials, talk about
everything you have tested and your key, data-driven learnings
Acknowledge if you are a concept or data driven startup

Don’t just have a dedicated competition slide.
“The best way to talk about competition, particularly if you're in a
contested market is to address it throughout the entire deck,”
 So, for example, when you’re on your market slide, address the holes in
the market created by the fact that the competition is falling short.”
- First Round Capital
Another good approach to handling competition in
your voiceover – always bring it up through the
prism of your advantages
These slides are your competition & differentiation
Fully disclose the extent of competition so it’s clear
you know your space. Why are you better?

If you have one key competitor who is

Remember that for a seed stage
company, the reasons to invest are
to achieve the milestones ahead of
the A. That message is in the title!
Finish with a flourish!
Your teaser commercial as a summary should work for a close.
You should have proven what you set out to prove, the unique
approach, differentiation, defensibility, economics, risk
management, upside, …
Remind the audience of your 30 second commercial narrative!
Even ask “did I convince you?”
